At this time, Matt Heffernan (SlithyMatt) is the only direct contributor to this repository.
If you want to contribute code, please fork the repo into your own GitHub and submit a pull request with your changes.
If you want to be a beta tester, simply download the latest release and submit any issues you find.
Please check the backlog of issues first, to prevent duplicate issues. Fixes will be initially pushed to the master
branch prior to the next release build for community verification. Interim builds will not be produced, so verifiers will
need to build the master branch themselves or wait until the next release build.

If you want to make changes in your fork that significantly change the game to make merger non-trivial, please set up
any pull requests carefully to make them incremental or prepare to be orphaned.

All contributions must be completely "free software" that can have the [GPL 3 license](LICENSE) applied.
No copyrighted code or any other type of proprietary media may be added to this repo. No contributors will
be compensated monetarily for their work, nor is it allowable for this software to be sold for any price.

Thanks, and enjoy!
